# webSiteReact
WIP for a more module website in react

If you want to test it: <br />
1) download and install node js and the node package manager (npm). <br />
A nice tutorial for windows users: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-FPCwZFU_8
2) clone the repository
3) In the terminal, go to the directory robomaster
4) Install the app's dependencies using "npm install"
5) Run a development server using "npm start"
